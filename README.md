Big Data presents incredibly advantageous, immeasurable and continuously increasing capabilities, which have had a beneficial influence on numerous aspects, such as the enhancement of the decision-making process and improved customer services of organizations. However, their achievement is known to be an extreme difficulty and challenge for businesses, due to the various sources of data, which have led to its unstructured and semi-structured format, related to the Variety attribute. Additionally, the level of dirtiness of the datasets and the erroneous data, also present major issues. The main discussion in the present paper are the fields of Big Data, data cleaning and data quality, as well as Big Data cleaning approaches are exhaustively investigated. In addition to that, the experimental development of a framework for dealing with Variety will be performed. The analysis this thesis provides is carried out from multiple peer-reviewed journals, articles and books. The conclusions from the paper are that, although preparing and cleansing unstructured or semi-structured data is extremely challenging and demanding to accomplish, it is worth the endeavour. Furthermore, the implemented prototype of the framework successfully demonstrates the valuable capabilities that Variety preparation and cleaning are able to present.
